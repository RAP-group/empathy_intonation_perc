Dear Dr. Joan Mora,

Thank you for taking the time to consider our manuscript Using intonation to disambiguate meaning: The role of empathy and proficiency in L2 perceptual development (APS-Feb-22-0015) for publication in Applied Psycholinguistics. Our understanding is that we needed to consider the reviewers’ comments and revise accordingly before the manuscript could be reevaluated for publication. We noted three specific areas that were consistently highlighted by the reviewers as needing improvement: use of terminology, motivation of the construct empathy as it pertains to our research questions, and description of the auditory stimuli. We have considered thoroughly the detailed feedback provided by all three reviewers and resubmit what we believe to be a much improved version of the manuscript. In this letter we address the reviewers’ concerns point-by-point. Where feasible, we quote all revised text in this document, otherwise, we refer the reader to the relevant sections of the revised manuscript. We thank you and the three anonymous reviewers for all comments and suggestions and again enthusiastically submit the revised manuscript for consideration in Applied Psycholinguistics.

Sincerely,
Joseph Casillas 
(corresponding author)
