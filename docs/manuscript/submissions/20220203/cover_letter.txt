Dear Editor of Applied Psycholinguistics,

Please consider the attached submission for publication in Applied Psycholinguistics and, at your discretion, submit it into the review process. The present submission reports the results of a study examining the development of intonation perception in a second language. The participants were English-speaking adult second language learners of Spanish. The goal of the study was to examine the relationship between proficiency and an individual pragmatic skill, empathy, as it pertains to the perception of intonation. The study is novel and relevant because it extends recent research examining the role of empathy in sentence processing to second language learners. In short, we show for the first time that the construct empathy plays a role in second language sentence processing. As the corresponding author I declare no conflicts of commitment. The manuscript has not been submitted for consideration for publication to any other publishing venue. The experiment was approved by an Institutional Review Board. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Joseph Casillas, PhD
