Dear Dr. Casillas,

APS-Feb-22-0015 entitled "Using intonation to disambiguate meaning: The role of empathy and proficiency in L2 perceptual development" which you submitted to Applied Psycholinguistics, has been reviewed.  The comments of the three reviewer(s) are included at the bottom of this letter. As you will see from their comments, they found your study to be interesting but they raised a number of issues that you must address for a resubmission. In particular Reviewer 1 asks for a revision that would make the use of terms consistent and more transparent to readers and further justification in motivating the link between empathy and intonation development (see also reviewers' comments in relation to the operationalization of empathy and the role of proficiency. It would also be important to more clearly motivate the hypotheses of the study and to motivate them further. I invite you to respond to the reviewer(s)' comments in detail and to revise your manuscript thoroughly according to their comments.
