abstract: |
  The present study investigates the interplay between proficiency and 
  individual pragmatic skill in the process of learning a new language. 
  Notably, we focus on the role of empathy in the development of second 
  language (L2) prosody by analyzing the perception and processing of 
  intonation in questions and statements in L2 Spanish. 
  The construct empathy has been shown to influence native language processing 
  in how listeners interpret intonation and meaning when words are ambiguous 
  [@esteve2020empathy]. 
  We extend this research to L2 acquisition in order to determine if 
  individual differences in pragmatic skills affect the development of 
  intonation in L2 processing and sentence comprehension. 
  A total of 225 adult L2 Spanish learners (L1 English) from the 
  Northeastern United States completed a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) 
  task in which they listened to four utterance types and categorized them as 
  either questions or statements. 
  We used Bayesian multilevel regression and Drift Diffusion modeling to 
  analyze the 2AFC data as a function of proficiency and empathy scores.
  The results showed that learner response accuracy and sensitivity to 
  intonation improved as a function of proficiency.
  Importantly, in high proficiency, high empathy learners (1) more information 
  was necessary to reach a decision and (2) responses came at a slower rate 
  when compared with low empathy learners at any proficiency level.
  Higher empathic individuals, in comparison with lower empathic 
  individuals, appear to be more sensitive to intonation cues in the process 
  of forming sound-meaning associations, though increased sensitivity does 
  not necessarily imply increased processing speed. 
  The results motivate the inclusion of measures of pragmatic skill, such as 
  empathy, to better account for intonational meaning processing and sentence 
  comprehension in second language acquisition.
