abstract: |
  The present study investigates the interplay between proficiency and empathy 
  in the development of second language (L2) prosody by analyzing the 
  perception and processing of intonation in questions and statements in L2 
  Spanish. A total of 225 adult L2 Spanish learners (L1 English) from the 
  Northeastern United States completed a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) 
  task in which they listened to four utterance types and categorized them as 
  either questions or statements. We used Bayesian multilevel regression and 
  Drift Diffusion modeling to analyze the 2AFC data as a function of 
  proficiency level and empathy scores for each utterance type. The results 
  show (1) learner response accuracy and sensitivity to intonation improved 
  as a function of proficiency, and (2) . 
  Higher empathic individuals, in comparison with lower empathic individuals, 
  appear to be more sensitive to intonation cues in the process of forming 
  sound-meaning associations, though increased sensitivity does not 
  necessarily imply increased processing speed. The results motivate the 
  inclusion of measures of pragmatic skill, such as empathy, to better account 
  for intonational meaning processing and sentence comprehension in second 
  language acquisition.
