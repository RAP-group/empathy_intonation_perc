bustin study details: 

Accuracy was high in match conditions, but accuracy in mismatch conditions was below chance for all L2 learners. 
Regarding response times, intermediate learners were the fastest overall, and native speakers were the slowest. 
Learners with lower proficiency processed statements faster than questions.

Bustin crit
Importantly, the authors stated that the study had some limitations. First, the nature of the task may have raised participants’ metalinguistic awareness of intonational differences since they were explicitly asked to compare the aural and visual stimuli. Additionally, the fact that participants were presented with two types of input (aural and visual) at the same time may have influenced their perception, considering that visual input has been shown to influence aural perception (Shook and Marian, 2013, NEED MORE REFS). Besides, the items used in the wh-question mismatch condition contained syntactic differences apart from intonational differences (e.g., ¿Por qué iba Daniel a Bolivia? vs Daniel iba a Bolivia). In this condition, participants may have been able to identify the mismatch since the beginning of the sentence by comparing the syntactic structure and word order without the need of intonational discrimination. This flaw may have influenced participants’ perception of wh-questions, which may explain why the results showed that wh-questions had the highest accuracy rate. Second, the authors mentioned that it is possible that dialectal or sociolectal variation could have influenced participants’ responses. In fact, the stimuli sentences included recordings of 8 different varieties of Spanish, but dialectal variation was not included in the analysis. Whether intonation perception varies across Spanish varieties still remains unclear. Lastly, the study did not include an objective measure of L2 proficiency. L2 proficiency was established based on the course that English-Spanish learners were enrolled in, which may not provide an accurate representation of L2 proficiency level. In spite of this, the proficiency effects reported in the study were found as expected.

<!-- trimble production 
For instance, @trimble2013acquiring analyzed L2 Spanish learners' production of intonational patterns for broad focus declaratives and absolute interrogatives after a semester-long study abroad program in Venezuela. 
For the majority of the learners production was more target-like at the end of the program, particularly for declaratives. 
The author also noted better outcomes in informal production and increased use of Spanish and high social integration were associated with production gains.
