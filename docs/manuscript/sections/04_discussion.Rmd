The present work explored how the comprehension of intonation develops in adult L2 learners of Spanish. 
We used a two-alternative forced-choice task in which participants determined whether or not utterances presented in auditory stimuli were questions. 
Our study represents a conceptual replication of @bustin_2020, but extends this research to address recent findings suggesting that individual pragmatic skill---in the context of the present work, empathy---plays a role in the process of forming sound-meaning associations. 
We used Bayesian methods, in particular Drift Diffusion modeling [@ratcliff2008diffusion], to analyze data from `r n_learners` L2 learners. 
We find that perception and processing of intonation develops in tandem with proficiency in the target language and is, to some degree, modulated by the construct empathy. 
This study set out to address three pre-registered research questions that we will now revisit. 

The first question, *Is perceptual development in L2 Spanish modulated by proficiency and intonation type?*, was developed as a direct result of the previous literature examining the acquisition of Spanish prosody [i.e., @bustin_2020; @trimble2013perceiving]. 
Response accuracy to all utterance types was positively correlated with proficiency, as measured by LexTALE scores. 
This corroborates the general finding that development of L2 intonation is positively correlated with target language proficiency, for both production [@henriksen2010development; @thornberry2014l2; @craft2015acquisition; @trimble2013acquiring, among others] and perception [@nibert2005acquisition; @nibert2006acquisition; @trimble2013perceiving; @bustin_2020]. 
In contrast with previous studies, our analyses conceptualized proficiency as a continuous variable, obviating the need to arbitrarily assign learners to proficiency groups. 
This operationalization will benefit future research interested in quantifying the effect of proficiency on perceptual development by allowing for more transparent designs with regard to statistical power and sample sizes. 
In line with previous studies [e.g., @bustin_2020], we found that yes/no questions were most difficult for L2 learners of Spanish, followed by wh- questions and broad focus and narrow focus statements. 
An exploratory analysis using d' found that learner sensitivity to the utterance types followed the same pattern. 
While it is not clear exactly why yes/no question are the most difficult, one possibility is that wh- questions pose less of a challenge because they contain a wh- word (e.g., *cuándo*, *cómo*, etc.). 
In other words, it might be the presence of a lexical cue in our task [and that of @bustin_2020] that facilitates the interpretation of a wh- question in addition to intonation. 
At this juncture this possibility cannot be discarded, though it is worth noting that the presence of these words alone does not imply a question. 
That is to say, in specific contexts these same words can appear in statements as well, in some cases with a pitch accent (i.e., *Qué beba María*) and in others without (i.e., *Que bebe María*).
A particular intonation contour is typically present to force a question interpretation and said contour can vary between and even within varieties.^[See Supplementary Materials for more information regarding the intonation contours observed in the stimuli of the present work.] 
Moreover, apart from the propositional content, a wh- question also implies a presupposition, and, thus, is more pragmatically complex. 
On the other hand, the yes/no questions in our experimental task have the same syntactic structure as the declarative statements. 
Perhaps for this reason yes/no questions require more effort and attention to intonation in order to distinguish them from statements in our task.

Additionally, our study addressed the question *Do pragmatic skills---specifically, empathy---modulate the rate of development in L2 prosody?* 
This question was motivated by a line of research showing that empathy influences language processing in monolingual populations [@esteve2016role; @esteve2020empathy; @orrico2020individual].
Though the construct *empathy* has been considered in the SLA literature, the current body of research is limited to studies on pronunciation accuracy [i.e., @guiora1972empathy; @rota2009cognitive, among others]. 
Thus, we extend research on empathy to L2 phonological acquisition as it relates to speech perception. 
Using a cross-sectional design, we show (1) that empathy, as measured by the empathy quotient [@baron2004empathy], did indeed modulate response accuracy and the decision-making process, and (2) *how* empathy affected sentence processing was related to L2 proficiency. 
Specifically, we found response accuracy increased as a function of proficiency, independent of empathy for yes/no questions, but not wh- questions. 
In the case of the latter, we found empathy to have a compounding effect on the correlation between accuracy and proficiency, such that higher empathy individuals showed more accuracy at lower proficiency levels when compared with their lower empathy counterparts. 
This is taken as evidence suggesting that empathy can potentially modulate the rate of development of L2 prosody. 
In other words, higher empathy individuals may develop L2 prosody at an earlier stage than lower empathy individuals. 
That being said, we do not find the same effect with yes/no questions. 
This finding is quite puzzling, particularly because previous research on sentence processing has found an effect for empathy in yes/no questions, e.g., in Salerno Italian [@orrico2020individual]. 
At this time, we are uncertain as to why our results differ in this regard, though the nature of the outcome variable measured in the task used in @orrico2020individual (certainty scores bounded at 0 and 100) may have provided a more fine-grained window into the effect of empathy. 

In addition to addressing response accuracy, we also show that for high proficiency, high empathy learners (1) more information was necessary to reach a decision and (2) responses came at a slower rate when compared with low empathy learners at any proficiency level. 
This interaction effect on sentence processing was found for both types of interrogative utterances. 
Previous research on monolingual populations has shown that higher empathy individuals are more sensitive to intonation cues in the process of forming sound-meaning associations than lower empathy individuals. 
Our findings support the notion that this is also true for adult L2 learners, though we show that increased sensitivity does not necessarily imply increased processing speed. 
Given that empathy comprises the cognitive process of identifying the emotional state of another living being as well as the affective process of experiencing a similar sensation within oneself, it is plausible that higher empathy individuals showed more sensitivity to intonation cues and unconsciously devoted cognitive efforts to this process because they tended to require more information during decision-making. 
On the contrary, other individuals, which did not require as much information for reaching a decision, likely did not employ the same cognitive and affective processes related to empathy. 

Our third research question addressed the effect of speaker variety on L2 perceptual development. 
Specifically, we asked *Does speaker variety affect perception accuracy and processing speed?* 
This question was motivated by @bustin_2020, who raised the possibility that dialectal or sociolectal variation could have influenced participants' responses in their data. 
Their study included stimuli from eight varieties of Spanish, though this factor was not considered in their analysis. 
Building on @bustin_2020, our auditory stimuli also included eight distinct varieties of Spanish. 
We found that, generally, speaker variety did indeed affect response accuracy. 
As was the case with our pilot data from monolingual Spanish speakers, learners were most accurate responding to stimuli from the speaker of Peninsular-Madrileño Spanish, and least accurate when responding to the Cuban variety.
Interestingly, accuracy with a given variety did not correlate with response times in a straightforward way. 
For instance, participants did not respond faster to the Peninsular-Madrileño variety even though they were more accurate in their responses to this speaker. 

The results of our study suggest that speaker variety does affect perception accuracy, though this does not necessarily map directly on to processing speed. 
One possibility put forward in the literature is that the variety matters insomuch that it is familiar to the listener [see @perry2018influences; @trimble2013perceiving]. 
In other words, learners may be more accurate and process speech faster when listening to a variety they know well. 
Our study took into consideration familiarity, though the variety that was cited as being the most familiar, U.S. Spanish (`r familiarity$UnitedStates$perc`% of `r n_learners` responses), was not one of the varieties presented in the stimuli.^[While participants mentioned familiarity with U.S. Spanish, it should be noted that this variety is not a monolith, but rather carries traits of the original Spanish variety (e.g., Mexican, Puerto Rican) that is in contact with English.]
Mexican (`r familiarity$Mexico$perc`%) and Peninsular-Madrileño (`r familiarity$Spain$perc`%) Spanish were reported as being the second and third most familiar varieties, and no participants indicated Cuban Spanish as being the variety they were most familiar with. 
To explore the effect of familiarity further, we conducted a non-preregistered analyses of the data from the participants who claimed to be most familiar with a Spanish variety that was included in our speaker varieties: Peninsular and Mexican Spanish.^[We make the assumption that 'Peninsular' is most closely associated with the Madrileño speaker.]
We coded the participants' responses to familiar versus unfamiliar varieties and fit a Bayesian logistic regression model to the data (See online supplementary materials for details). 
In short, we find that, marginalizing over proficiency and empathy, participants were indeed more accurate when responding to a familiar variety. 
This is true for all utterance types to a certain extent, but is more clearly the case for questions, likely because responses to declarative utterances were near ceiling. 
Figure \@ref(fig:plot-learner-variety-familiarity) plots the familiarity effect for this subset of the data.

Values represent posterior medians along with the 95% HDI for unfamiliar and familiar conditions (left panel), as well as the posterior difference (familiar - unfamiliar; right panel). The posterior predictive distribution is based on data from `r familiarity$Mexico$n_v + familiarity$Spain$n_v` participants who claimed to be familiar with Mexican (n = `r familiarity$Mexico$n_v`) and Peninsular (n = `r familiarity$Spain$n_v`) Spanish.

Another plausible explanation for variety-specific difficulties lies in cross-linguistic differences in the prosodic realizations of the distinct utterance types. 
Yes/no questions in Peninsular-Madrileño Spanish, for example, have the common final rise found in many other varieties of Spanish, as well as Standard American English. 
Cuban and Puerto Rican Spanish, on the other hand, typically have a final fall [See @alvord2006spanish; @armstrong2012development; @hualde2015intonational; @armstrong2010puerto; @sosa1999, among others]. 
In our data, we do indeed find that L2 and native listeners are less accurate when responding to stimuli with final falls (See online supplementary materials for exploratory analyses), though these varieties were also considered to be less familiar. 
Ultimately our experimental design does not allow us to say definitively whether dialectal variation at the suprasegmental level accounts for variety-specific difficulties (as opposed to additional variation at the level of the segment, for example), though this reasoning is in line with previous studies, i.e., @trimble2013perceiving. 

A final possibility is that speech rate differences associated with the speakers of the stimuli we used may have resulted in some varieties being more or less difficult for the learners [See @baese2019perceptual]. 
In an exploratory analysis of the auditory stimuli, we found that speech rate had no effect on response accuracy, as some of the varieties to which participants responded most accurately were also the fastest (e.g., the stimuli from our Mexican speaker). 
See Figure \@ref(fig:plot-sm-random-speech-rate) of the supplementary materials for visualizations and further discussion.

In sum, the present work contributes to our knowledge of an understudied construct, empathy, as it pertains to speech. 
Additionally, this is the first time, to our knowledge, that drift diffusion models have been used to analyze behavioral data relating to empathy in SLA. 
We also underscore the general need for models of L2 phonology, such as the SLM-r [@flege2021revised], PAM-L2 [@Best2007], L2LP [@VanLeussen2015], etc., to address the acquisition process beyond the level of the segment. 
The LILt model [@mennen2015beyond] has served as a starting point in the analysis of intonation across languages and L2 acquisition of intonation, framing the process of L2 acquisition of intonation along different developmental and structural dimensions, and has provided the theoretical grounding for numerous L2 studies [See @alvarado2022prosodic; @sanchez2022acquisition, among others]. 
The findings of the present study are in line with LILt since they show that perception of intonation in an L2 progresses with higher proficiency. 
In addition, these findings also emphasize the need for models like LILt to account for how individual differences pragmatic skills, such as empathy, can influence learner outcomes.
A complete model of speech learning should account for both causal prediction and imputation at the segmental and suprasegmental levels. 
The present study aimed to address this gap in the literature by examining the role of proficiency and empathy on the perception of intonation during sentence processing in adult L2 phonological acquisition. 

While the findings of our research suggest there is a relationship between target language proficiency and empathy, it is important to underscore that we do not make any claims about causality. 
Future research would benefit from considering the learnability of empathy [i.e., @bertrand2018learning; @lam2011empathy] as it relates to L2 outcomes. 
Furthermore, the cross-sectional design of the present work is not ideal for addressing how empathy levels affect the rate at which perception of L2 intonation develops. 
Only longitudinal data can appropriately address this issue. 
On that note, at this time, research on speech perception and empathy is limited to intonation. 
A fruitful avenue for novel research ought to examine how empathy is related to perception and spoken word recognition at the segmental level. 
A primary focus of the present project was to expand the line of research involving empathy and intonation perception in two ways: first, to individuals with different linguistic experience (specifically, L2 learners), and, second, to different communicative situations (utterance types). 
This project was not concerned with understanding *why* different pitch contours affect intonation perception, particularly with regard to the role of empathy, primarily because there is inherent variability in how speakers realize their communicative intentions, at both the variety and individual-level, within utterance types. 
This variability is also present in our stimuli. 
Future research would benefit from exploring *why* and *how* particular acoustic realizations of pitch within utterance types lead to distinct processing outcomes and how they might interact with pragmatic skill. 

# Conclusion

The present study investigated the development of L2 perception of intonation. 
Specifically, this study explored the relationship between target language proficiency and an individual pragmatic skill, empathy, in the process of learning Spanish as a second language by analyzing the perception of intonation in questions and statements. 
We find that perception of intonation in sentence processing develops in tandem with proficiency in the target language and interacts with individual empathy levels, supporting the general conclusion that higher empathic individuals, in comparison with lower empathic individuals, appear to be more sensitive to intonation cues in the process of forming sound-meaning associations.
Importantly, increased sensitivity does not necessarily entail increased processing speed. 
The results motivate the inclusion of measures of pragmatic skill, such as empathy, to better account for intonational meaning processing and sentence comprehension in second language acquisition research.
