INTRO OUTLINE

- Intro - Current study is a conceptual replication of Brandl et al. (2020) 
  - Extend current findings on perceptual development to include pragmatic 
  skills (empathy)
    - Build on studies that look at the role of individual pragmatic skills 
    in language processing
      - And if individual differences in pragmatic skills affect the 
      development of intonation in L2 processing and sentence comprehension 
    - Examine the role of empathy in the development of L2 prosody by 
    analyzing the perception of intonation in questions and statements in L2 
    Spanish



- Background and motivation 
  - L2 acquisition of prosody (general)
    - Learners often struggle with L2 intonation, resulting in comprehension 
    and communication difficulties (Trofimovich and Baker, 2006)
    - indicator of L2 accent
    - intonation is not generally taught in the L2 classroom
    - last aspects of l2 phonology for learners to acquire
  - Acquisition of Spanish prosody
    - Mastery seems possible (more target-like as prof. increases)
    - Utterance type matters
      - Statements easier than questions
      - ‘Yes/No’-type questions are harder to process and acquire, when 
      compared with wh-questions and simple statements (Brandl et al., 2000) 
    - Familiarity matters
      - Positive correlation between accuracy and familiarity with variety
      - Important because of lots of variability in spanish prosody
  - Empathy
    - Info on construct (Carruthers, 2009; Baron-Cohen & Wheelwhright, 2004; 
    Baron-Cohen, 2011; Frith & Frith, 2003)
      - Relies on inferring the intentions, understanding the feelings, 
      and emotions of others
      - Associated with Theory of Mind and perspective-taking
      - used as a measure to tap into individual pragmatic skills
    - Empathy as proxy for pragmatic skill
      - Empathy influences native language processing in how listeners 
      interpret intonation and meaning when words are ambiguous 
      (Esteve-Gilbert et al., 2020). 
        - Higher empathy individuals appear to be more sensitive to 
        intonation cues in the process of forming sound-meaning associations 
        than lower empathy individuals 
        - Higher empathy (more pragmatic skilled individuals) = ability to 
        use intonation to resolve temporary lexical ambiguity that can lead 
        to confirmatory vs. contrasting interpretations 
- Current study (RQs): 
  - RQ1: Is perceptual development in L2 Spanish modulated by proficiency 
  and intonation type (i.e., Brandl et al., 2020)? 
  - RQ2: Do pragmatic skills, specifically, empathy, modulate the rate of 
  development in L2 prosody? 
  - RQ3: Does speaker variety affect perception accuracy and processing speed?

Additional Notes

rhythm and intonation are perceptually salient when listening to a language 

prosodic features considered fundamental factors in the perception of foreign accent, above other grammatical or pronunciation features (Munro 1995; Jilka 2000; Pettorino, De Meo and Vitale 2014).


Through proper control of prosody, a learner not only has a better capacity to produce understandable, natural, and expressive sequences of speech, but also an improved ability to understand speech and to read and speak more fluently across different communicative situations. 

being intelligible at the segmental level does not encompass being pragmatically understood, which is crucial since discourse needs to be appropriate to the communicative situation at hand.


maintaining the prosodic characteristics of the L1 when speaking another language often leads to misunderstandings, as the same prosodic scheme may be associated with different linguistic or paralinguistic contents in both languages in question (Cruz-Ferreira 1987; Pickering 2001; de-la-Mota 2004; Chen 2005; Mennen 2007).

related to social inclusion: “critical for L2 pronunciation because it plays a major role in cementing social bonds as a key marker of social identity” (Levis 2016, 154). 


Certain linguistic content (e.g., sentence type or pragmatic nuances) can be conveyed in different geolects by means of different prosodic strategies, that is, while there are prosodic patterns that seem to be quite widespread, others are restricted to specific regions as instances of microvariation. This is the case with the declarative circumflex (i.e., rise–fall) contour of Mexican Spanish, Argentinian Spanish’s long fall, and Caribbean Spanish’s nuclear hat pattern in yes–no questions (Hualde and Prieto 2015).

Conversely, the same pitch accent of a certain intonation contour can be produced differently by speakers from different geolectal varieties in terms of pitch movement and syllabic duration; for example, the main difference between the production of a neutral declarative sentence in Madrid Peninsular Spanish and in Buenos Aires Argentinian Spanish is that in the latter, the nuclear syllable is longer (Estebas-Vilaplana 2010, 167).


Still, theoretical work on acquisition that specifically takes into account L2 Spanish prosody remains sparse (see Cortés 2002a, 2002b; Radel 2008).
