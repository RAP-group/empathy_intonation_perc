INTRO OUTLINE

- Intro - Current study is a conceptual replication of Brandl et al. (2020) 
  - Extend current findings on perceptual development to include pragmatic 
  skills (empathy)
    - Build on studies that look at the role of individual pragmatic skills 
    in language processing
      - And if individual differences in pragmatic skills affect the 
      development of intonation in L2 processing and sentence comprehension 
    - Examine the role of empathy in the development of L2 prosody by 
    analyzing the perception of intonation in questions and statements in L2 
    Spanish



- Background and motivation 
  - L2 acquisition of prosody (general)
    - Learners often struggle with L2 intonation, resulting in comprehension 
    and communication difficulties (Trofimovich and Baker, 2006)
    - indicator of L2 accent
    - intonation is not generally taught in the L2 classroom
    - last aspects of l2 phonology for learners to acquire
  - Acquisition of Spanish prosody
    - Mastery seems possible (more target-like as prof. increases)
    - Utterance type matters
      - Statements easier than questions
      - ‘Yes/No’-type questions are harder to process and acquire, when 
      compared with wh-questions and simple statements (Brandl et al., 2000) 
    - Familiarity matters
      - Positive correlation between accuracy and familiarity with variety
      - Important because of lots of variability in spanish prosody
  - Empathy
    - Info on construct (Carruthers, 2009; Baron-Cohen & Wheelwhright, 2004; 
    Baron-Cohen, 2011; Frith & Frith, 2003)
      - Relies on inferring the intentions, understanding the feelings, 
      and emotions of others
      - Associated with Theory of Mind and perspective-taking
      - used as a measure to tap into individual pragmatic skills
    - Empathy as proxy for pragmatic skill
      - Empathy influences native language processing in how listeners 
      interpret intonation and meaning when words are ambiguous 
      (Esteve-Gilbert et al., 2020). 
        - Higher empathy individuals appear to be more sensitive to 
        intonation cues in the process of forming sound-meaning associations 
        than lower empathy individuals 
        - Higher empathy (more pragmatic skilled individuals) = ability to 
        use intonation to resolve temporary lexical ambiguity that can lead 
        to confirmatory vs. contrasting interpretations 
- Current study (RQs): 
  - RQ1: Is perceptual development in L2 Spanish modulated by proficiency 
  and intonation type (i.e., Brandl et al., 2020)? 
  - RQ2: Do pragmatic skills, specifically, empathy, modulate the rate of 
  development in L2 prosody? 
  - RQ3: Does speaker variety affect perception accuracy and processing speed?
