guiora_1968

- first to hypothesize that the capacity for empathy contributes to the mastery of the pronunciation of a second language
- empathy test scores compared with ratings of pronunciation authenticity 
- Empathy measured as accuracy recognizing changes in micro-momentary facial expressions in video clips
- Dubious operationalization of empathy and questionable external validity
- Small sample size (n = 10, n = 30), does not present results (this is a report about a presentation)




guiora1972empathy

- Empathy linked to L2 pronunciation (series of studies we investigated the hypothesis that empathy plays a significant role in the ability to authentically pronounce a second language.)
- 411 Learners of Japanese, Chinese-Mandarin, Thai, Spanish and Russian from Defense Language Institute 
- Given battery of tests to measure empathy (TAT, PPT, LET, MME)
- Low overall correlation, split data by language
- found positive correlation between MME and pronunciation authenticity for some languages 
- higher empathy measured as seeing more changes in facial expressions in film clip (later failed to replicate. see taylor1971psychological)

About this research: cognitive aspects of language talent: "empathy in speaker and learning a foreign accent is perhaps not a myth, but a must to be further elucidated" p 73

More tidbits: 

the earliest attempts to measure empathy: 
  Dymond (1948) (score TAT responses, Thematic Apperception Test)
  Dymond, Hughes, & Raabe (1952)
  Feffer (1959)
  Mahoney (1960)
Approaches from clinical research (motivation for Guiora's MME technique): 
  Wallach and Strupp (1960)
  Truax (1963)
  Haggard and Isaacs (1966)




guiora1972effects

- Empathy: can be conceptualized as a comprehending modality alongside inference and intuition 
- Empathy: a process of comprehending in which a temporary fusion of self-object boundaries permits an immediate emotional apprehension of the affective experience of another, this sensing being used by the cognitive functions to gain understanding of the other.
- 87 students, half given alcohol
- Study touted as evidence that empathy affects L2 pronunciation, but didn't measure empathy directly



brown1973affective

- call for study of affective variables
- at time (1973), understudied in SLA
- 'Empathy is the process of “putting yourself into someone else's shoes,” of reaching beyond the self and understanding and feeling what another person is understanding or feeling'
- language is one of the primary means of empathizing
- need to discover if empathy is something one can learn (for discussion)
- may be a relationship for speaking only (based on Guiora's work), and not for comprehending





guiora1979personality

- theoretical paper, pushing for construct validity in SLA
- rehashes language ego ideas from previous work, focus on L2 pronunciation
- rehashes MME test of empathy from 1972empathy paper
- concludes that follow ups suggest MME was unreliable measure of empathy, questionable internal validity






rota2009cognitive

- investigated crucial cognitive factors and tested their relevance in groups of subjects classified on the basis of their proficiency and talent in L2 pronunciation
- empathy: the ability to perceive and feel the emotional states of others, the emotional resonance that takes place in an individual when he/she engages in an affective communication or in an emotional exchange
- alternative perspective: emphasizes the cognitive components of empathy, defines it as cognitive understanding of the other’s situation, based on the capacity of assuming his/her point of view on things (the perspective taking hypothesis, Hogan 1969)
- in study: 
  - used E-Scale, a psychometrically sound instrument devised by Leibetseder and colleagues (2001)
  - operationalize empathy as the effort to identify with persons in fictitious or real-life situations (Leibetseder et al. 2007)
  - assess L2 german pronunciation, search for correlations with a battery of measures (proficiency, talent, scores on the Modern Language Aptitude Test (MLAT), Hindi (as an unknown language) imitation and E-IQs scores) 
  - arbitrarily partition subjs into 3 groups based on E-IQ (talented, average talent, anti-talent)
  - found correlations described as being in the "weak-middle" range 
  - conclude: the theory of Empathy in speaking and learning a foreign accent is perhaps not a myth, but a must to be further elucidated (p. 73)




chen2013empathy

- talks about the role of empathy as a contributor to intercultural communicative competence. 
- proposes that understanding who we are culturally is the first step to becoming empathetic towards other cultures. 
- The second step is to realize the differences between one's own culture and foreign cultures. 





HU2013366

- revisits individual differences in L2 pronunciation
- goal is to investigate behavioural and neurobiological predictors of advanced L2 learning
- phonetic coding ability and empathy, but not phonological working memory, predict L2 pronunciation aptitude in advanced learners
- acquisition of L2 pronunciation aptitude is dynamic process, requiring variety of neural resources at different processing stages over time
- used empathy quotient
- 2 tasks: sentence imitation and sentence discrimination





liu2017

- proposes that emotion factors (motivation, attitude, interest, self-confidence, self-esteem, anxiety and empathy) directly influence the acquisition behavior of second language learners. 
- proposes countermeasures for mobilizing positive emotion in L2 classroom
- nothing great here, but considers the construct in the context of teachers being more empathetic towards beginning learners



gholamrezapour2019empathy

- investigated the relationship between empathy and authentic pronunciation
- 69 Iranian undergraduate EFL learners
- Basic Empathy Scale (BES: Jolliffe & Farrington, 2006)
- oral interview twice (before and after segmental form-focused instruction)
- those in the high-level group (i.e., more empathic learners) were more successful in acquiring authentic pronunciation than those in the low-level group
- sketchy evaluation of pronunciation, sketchy stats (averaged ratings, t-test of arbitrarily dichotemized groups)
