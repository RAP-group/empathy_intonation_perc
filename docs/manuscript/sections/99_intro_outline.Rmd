chen2013empathy

- talks about the role of empathy as a contributor to intercultural communicative competence. 
- proposes that understanding who we are culturally is the first step to becoming empathetic towards other cultures. 
- The second step is to realize the differences between one's own culture and foreign cultures. 




guiora_1968

- first to hypothesize that the capacity for empathy contributes to the mastery of the pronunciation of a second language
- empathy test scores compared with ratings of pronunciation authenticity 
- Empathy measured as accuracy recognizing changes in micro-momentary facial expresions in video clips
- Dubious operationalization of empathy and questionable external validity
- Small sample size (n = 10, n = 30), does not present results (this is a report about a presentation)




guiora1972empathy

- Empathy linked to L2 pronunciation (series of studies we investigated the hypothesis that empathy plays a significant role in the ability to authentically pronounce a second language.)
- 411 Learners of Japanese, Chinese-Mandarin, Thai, Spanish and Russian from Defense Language Institute 
- Given battery of tests to measure empathy (TAT, PPT, LET, MME)
- Low overall correlation, split data by language
- found positive correlation between MME and pronunciation authenticity for some languages 
- higher empathy measured as seeing more changes in facial expressions in film clip (later failed to replicate. see taylor1971psychological)

About this research: cognitive aspects of language talent: "empathy in speaker and learning a foreign accent is perhaps not a myth, but a must to be further elucidated" p 73

More tidbits: 

the earliest attempts to measure empathy: 
  Dymond (1948) (score TAT responses, Thematic Apperception Test)
  Dymond, Hughes, & Raabe (1952)
  Feffer (1959)
  Mahoney (1960)
Approaches from clinical research (motivation for Guiora's MME technique): 
  Wallach and Strupp (1960)
  Truax (1963)
  Haggard and Isaacs (1966)




guiora1972effects

- Empathy: can be conceptualized as a comprehending modality alongside inference and intuition 
- Empathy: a process of comprehending in which a temporary fusion of self-object boundaries permits an immediate emotional apprehension of the affective experience of another, this sensing being used by the cognitive functions to gain understanding of the other.
- 87 students, half given alcohol
- Study touted as evidence that empathy affects L2 pronunciation, but didn't measure empathy directly



brown1973affective

- call for study of affective variables
- at time (1973), understudied in SLA
- 'Empathy is the process of “putting yourself into someone else's shoes,” of reaching beyond the self and understanding and feeling what another person is understanding or feeling'
- language is one of the primary means of empathizing
- need to discover if empathy is something one can learn (for discussion)
- may be a relationship for speaking only (based on Guiora's work), and not for comprehending

research on affective variables in SLA is not new, however the focus has centered on a few variables, such as attitude, motivation, and more recently grit, among others. 
Empathy received attention from scholars in SLA as early as the 70's, when guiora and colleagues considered XXXX... 
Empircle work on the subject is scant. 
Studies on L2 phonological acquisition are non-existant to the best of our knowledge, though XXX has associated empathy with better outcomes in L2 pronunciation. 

The work on connecting empathy and pronunciation which Guiora led had some limited success but was criticized for experiments which sought to improve L2 pronunciation by enhancing ego permeability and empathy through use of alcohol and relaxant drugs


knowledge of more languages is not linked to cognitive empathy (dewaele_2012)
