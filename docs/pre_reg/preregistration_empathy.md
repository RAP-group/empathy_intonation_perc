================

# Preregistration RMarkdown

We can edit this document as we make determinations in regard to the
design of our project and prior to data collection. At least some of
this information has overlap with the IRB.

# Study Information

### Hypotheses

List specific, concise, and testable hypotheses. Please state if the
hypotheses are directional or non-directional. If directional, state the
direction. A predicted effect is also appropriate here. If a specific
interaction or moderation is important to your research, you can list
that as a separate hypothesis.

# Design Plan

### Study type

*Please check one of the following statements*

1.  Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study
    subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known
    as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled
    trials.

2.  Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are
    not randomly assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys,
    “natural experiments,” and regression discontinuity designs.

3.  Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies.

4.  Other

### Blinding\*

*Blinding describes who is aware of the experimental manipulations
within a study. Mark all that apply.*

1.  No blinding is involved in this study.

2.  For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the
    treatment group to which they have been assigned.

3.  Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects (either
    human or non-human subjects) will not be aware of the assigned
    treatments. (Commonly known as “double blind”)

4.  Personnel who analyze the data collected from the study are not
    aware of the treatment applied to any given group.

### Is there any additional blinding in this study?

### Study design\*

Describe your study design. The key is to be as detailed as is necessary
given the specific parameters of the design. There may be some overlap
between this question and the following questions. That is OK, as long
as sufficient detail is given in one of the areas to provide all of the
requested information. Examples include two-group, factorial, randomized
block, and repeated measures. Is it a between (unpaired), within-subject
(paired), or mixed design? Describe any counterbalancing required.

You may attach up to 5 file(s) to this question. You may attach files
that you already have in OSF Storage in this project or upload (drag and
drop) a new file from your computer. Uploaded files will automatically
be added to this project so that they can be registered. To attach files
from other components or an add-on, first add them to this project.

### Randomization

If you are doing a randomized study, state how you will randomize, and
at what level. Typical randomization techniques include: simple, block,
stratified, and adaptive covariate randomization. If randomization is
required for the study, the method should be specified here, not simply
the source of random numbers.

# Sampling Plan

### Existing Data

*Preregistration is designed to make clear the distinction between
confirmatory tests, specified prior to seeing the data, and exploratory
analyses conducted after observing the data. Therefore, creating a
research plan in which existing data will be used presents unique
challenges. Please select the description that best describes your
situation. See <https://cos.io/prereg> for more information.*

1.  Registration prior to creation of data

2.  Registration prior to any human observation of the data

3.  Registration prior to accessing the data

4.  Registration prior to analysis of the data

5.  Registration following analysis of the data

### Explanation of existing data

If you indicate that you will be using some data that already exist in
this study, please describe the steps you have taken to assure that you
are unaware of any patterns or summary statistics in the data. This may
include an explanation of how access to the data has been limited, who
has observed the data, or how you have avoided observing any analysis of
the specific data you will use in your study.

**answer text here**

### Data collection procedures\*

Please describe the process by which you will collect your data and your
inclusion and exclusion criteria. If you are using human subjects, this
should include the population from which you obtain subjects,
recruitment efforts, payment for participation, how subjects will be
selected for eligibility from the initial pool, and your study timeline.
For studies that don’t include human subjects, include information about
how you will collect samples, duration of data gathering efforts, source
or location of samples, or batch numbers you will use.

**answer text here**

You may attach up to 5 file(s) to this question.

### Sample size\*

Describe the sample size of your study. How many units will be analyzed
in the study? This could be the number of people, birds, classrooms,
plots, or countries included. If the units are not individuals, then
describe the size requirements for each unit. If you are using a
clustered or multilevel design, describe how many units are you
collecting at each level of the analysis. This might be the number of
samples or a range, minimum, or maximum.

**answer text here**

### Sample size rationale

This could include a power analysis or an arbitrary constraint such as
time, money, or personnel.

**answer text here**

### Stopping rule

If your data collection procedures do not give you full control over
your exact sample size, specify how you will decide when to terminate
your data collection. If you are using sequential analysis, include your
pre-specified thresholds.

# Variables

### Manipulated variables

Precisely define all variables you plan to manipulate and the levels or
treatment arms of each variable. This is not applicable to any
observational study.

**answer text here**

You may attach up to 5 file(s) to this question. You may attach files
that you already have in OSF Storage in this project or upload (drag and
drop) a new file from your computer. Uploaded files will automatically
be added to this project so that they can be registered. To attach files
from other components or an add-on, first add them to this project.

### Measured variables\*

Precisely define each variable that you will measure. This will include
outcome measures, as well as any measured predictors or covariates.

from other components or an add-on, first add them to this project.

### Indices

If applicable, please define how measures will be combined into an index
(or even a mean) and what measures will be used. Include either a
formula or a precise description of the method. If you are using a more
complicated statistical method to combine measures (e.g. a factor
analysis), please note that here but describe the exact method in the
analysis plan section.

# Analysis Plan

### Statistical models\*

What statistical model will you use to test each hypothesis? Please
include the type of model (e.g. ANOVA, RMANOVA, MANOVA, multiple
regression, SEM, etc) and the specification of the model. This includes
each variable that will be included, all interactions, subgroup
analyses, pairwise or complex contrasts, and any follow-up tests from
omnibus tests. If you plan on using any positive controls, negative
controls, or manipulation checks you may mention that here. Provide
enough detail so that another person could run the same analysis with
the information provided. Remember that in your final article any test
not included here must be noted as exploratory and that you must report
the results of all tests.

### Inference criteria

What criteria will you use to make inferences? Please describe the
information you’ll use (e.g. specify the p-values, Bayes factors,
specific model fit indices), as well as cut-off criterion, where
appropriate. Will you be using one or two tailed tests for each of your
analyses? If you are comparing multiple conditions or testing multiple
hypotheses, will you account for this?

**answer text here**

### Data exclusion

How will you determine which data points or samples if any to exclude
from your analyses? How will outliers be handled? Will you use any
awareness check?

**answer text here**

### Missing data

How will you deal with incomplete or missing data?

**answer text here**

### Exploratory analysis

If you plan to explore your data to look for unspecified differences or
relationships, you may include those plans here. If you list an
exploratory test here, you are not obligated to report its results. But
if you do report it you are obligated to describe it as an exploratory
result.
